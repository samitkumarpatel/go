## 00-variable

- lower case first letter for package scope
- upper case first letter to export
- no private scope. but you can declare a variable within a block and that variable can only be access with in that block.

```go
package main
import ( "fmt" )

var k float32 = 42

// group of variables and assignment
var (
    actorName string = ""
    companion string = ""
    doctorNumber int = 3
    season int = 11
)

var I int = 100 // Globally visible

func main() {
    var i int // declare a variable but not initializing to it
    i = 42 //assign
    i = 27 // update previous value of i

    var i int = 42 // can replace like this from above
    i := 42 // shortend way to declare and assign a variable

    var j float32 = 27
    fmt.Printf("%v, %T",i,j) // %v print value and %T print type

    // group of variable
    var (
        eId int = 1001
        name string = "x"
        ...
    )

    var i int = 10
    i := 20 // This will error out, bcoz i is already declare

}
```
## 01-primitives
The types in Go can be classified as follows âˆ’
- Boolean types
- Numeric types
- String types
- Derived types
The more details can be found in [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/go/go_data_types.htm) and well explained in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS4e4q9oBaU&t=3425s)


## 02-constants

- Immutable , but can be changed
- Replaced by the compiler at compile time
    - value must be calculated at compile time
- Named like variable
    - PascalCase for exported constant
    - camelCase for internal constant
- Typed constants work like immutable variables
    - Can interoperate only with same type
- UnTyped Constants work like immutable variables
    - can interoperate only with similar type
- Enumerated contsnat
    - special symbol iota allows related constants to be created easily
    - iota starts at 0 in each const block and increaments by one
    - Watch out of constant values that matches zero value for variable
- Enumerated expressions
    - Operations that can be determined at compile time are allowed
        - arithmetic
        - bitwise operations
        - bitshifting


## 03-Array-n-Slices
- Array
    - Collection of items with same type
    - Fixed Size
    - Declaration styles
        - a := [3]int{1,2,3}
        - a := [...]int{1,2,3}
        - var a [3]int
    - The index start from 0
    - len function returns size of array
    - Copies refers to different underlying data

- Slices
    - Backed by array
    - Creation style
        - Slice existing array or slice
        - literal style
        - Via Make function
            - a :=make([]int, 10) //create slice with capacity and length == 10
            - a :=make([]int, 10, 100) // crate slice with length == 10 and capacity == 100
        - len function returns of slice
        - cap function returns length of underlying array.
        - append function to add elements to slice
        - copies refers to same underlying array 


## 04-maps-n-structs
Both are collection types.

- maps
    - collection of value types that are accessed via keys
    - created via literals or via make function
    - Maps accessed via [key] syntex
    - Check for presence with "value, ok" form of result
    - multiple assignments refer to same underlying data

- Structs
    - Collection of disparated data types that describe a single concept
    - Keyed by named fields
    - Normally created as types, but anonymous structuts are allowed
    - Structs are value types
    - No inharitance , but can se composition via embedding
    - Tags can be added to struct fields to describe 


## Control Flow
- if and switch statement


```go
package main

import ("fmt")

func main() {
    
}

```

## Template
```go
package main

import ("fmt")

func main() {
    
}

```
